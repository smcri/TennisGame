Update 02.06.2014 (AI and winning condition):
- Added PlayerAI Script that implements a simple AI. You must attach this script to left or right player GameObject.
- Added PingPongAI Scene that is like the PingPong Scene but with one player controlled by the AI.
- Updated ScoreUI with a winning condition of a score count.
